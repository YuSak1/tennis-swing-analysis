As a recreational tennis player, I've always wanted to hit beautiful shots like the best tennis players like Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray. To improve my game, I study their techniques on TV, trying to emulate their shots. I believe many tennis enthusiasts share this same passion.

There are a variety of play styles among the top professional tennis players. For example, Federer and Nadal have distinctly different forehand shots. If you can identify which playerâ€™s style is similar to yours, you can use them as a role model to improve your shots. This is the motivation behind this project.

In this project, I developed a model that analyzes videos of forehand shots, compares them to four professional players, and highlights the similar features.
